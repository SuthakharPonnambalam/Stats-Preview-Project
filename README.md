## Overview

The notion of this challenge was to recreate a stats preview component that was provided. The necessary images and style components were provided and the intention was to recreate the design as close as possible to meet the requirements.

## My Process

1. I started getting the HTML component first and then proceeded to the CSS part. I had used several semantic tags like main and section to improve readability. The main was designed to be a flexbox with two components. 
2. In the CSS, I started working on the left pane initially as it had several blocks within it. 
    * The heading component was made as a container and used a span for styling a particular word. Appropriate font was added to it. 
    * The paragraph component was also using the same component and was made as a seperate container to enable margin and padding properties for alignment. 
    * The stats section was made a seperate container and was given a flex properties. The alignment was achieved using justify content: space between property. I've also made it take 80% width of it's parent container so that alignment meets the requirement. 
3. The right pane only had one section and an image was added to it. The image uses an opacity of 0.5 to allow for the background color to seep through. 
4. Finally all the four edges were made rounded using seperate border radius property and the body was given a background color. 
5. The font used is referenced to Lexend Deca on google fonts. 

## Built With 

The webpage was created using HTML and CSS and is hosted on Github pages. 
1. Semantic HTML5
2. CSS 3
3. Flexbox

## What I learned?

The learning was great. I learnt a lot about flexbox properties, hsl color coding, background properties to name a few. More importantly I learnt how to start and proceed to get the desired output. I would appreciate all the feedback to improve the existing codebase 

## Continued developement 

I have one major area where I could use a bit of help. The page is not responsive currently. I have been trying to use media queries but they don't seem to be working (or I don't know how to work with them!), hence I request the community to shed some light and guide me through.
